# Complete re-write. Tested on 1.17.

# What's new, vs before?
Designed for modern Paper/Spigot versions, now more optimized than ever.
Everything has been carefully designed to NOT cause lag this time.
Telepads will not be the root cause of tick drops, ever.
Far more simple under the hood. After re-writing this two to three times from scratch I can say I've finally come up with the fastest and cleanest Telepads plugin yet.

## Telepad Networks:
Networks are different from linked Telepads.
A unique network has it's very own specific center material, different from others.
Telepads on different networks are not linked, even with the same 4 materials.
This allows server admins to create "admin-only" telepads for Spawn, Minigames, etc, with no survival overlap.

## What's left todo?
Finish the core -- clean and make the style consistent.
Add events and a proper API for other developers to use if desired.
Add plenty of configuration/permission/effect options for every aspect of the plugin possible.

## Will the plugin be paid?
Only if you choose to buy it! When the plugin is complete, compiled jars will be available from SpigotMC, as always, for a small price. This is considered a donation for my time and effort. Though nothing is stopping you from building your own jar from this source, it's the same plugin!
